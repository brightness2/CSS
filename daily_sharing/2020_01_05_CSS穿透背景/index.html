            <h2>Fire</h2>
            <p>A wildfire, wildland fire or rural fire is an 
                uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible veget
                ation occurring in rural areas.[1] Depending on 
                the type of vegetation present, a wildfire can also
                be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bushfire
                (in Australia), desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill 
                fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.[2] Many organizations 
                consider wildfire to mean an unplanned and unwanted fire,[3] while 
                wildland fire is a broader term that includes prescribed fire as well as wildland 
                fire use (WFU; these are also called monitored response fires).[4][5]</p>
